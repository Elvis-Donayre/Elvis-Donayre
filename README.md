# üëã Hi, I'm Elvis Donayre!

![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=Elvis-Donayre&color=blue)

Data analyst and aspiring data scientist with experience in the public sector, specialized in innovation initiatives and digital transformation. Currently working as an Auxiliary Verifier at SUNAT, where I develop analytical solutions using Excel, VBA, SQL, Python, Power BI, and Tableau to optimize tax collection and improve operational efficiency.
My expertise focuses on analyzing large volumes of data using advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques. I have successfully implemented various projects that demonstrate my technical capabilities:

‚úÖ Developed a credit scoring system with balancing techniques (SMOTE) that minimizes false positives and optimizes precision through a custom threshold (0.3)

‚úÖ Created a sentiment classifier for tweets with 78.38% accuracy using XGBoost and LightGBM with enriched features

‚úÖ Implemented predictive models with BigQuery ML on Google Analytics data, transforming complex structures using advanced SQL

‚úÖ Designed an e-commerce content generator with microservices architecture integrating web scraping, computer vision, and LLMs

I work with tools such as TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Plotly, and Matplotlib, applying the latest advances in artificial intelligence and big data to classification, regression, clustering, time series, and NLP projects.
I complement my technical skills with leadership and effective communication capabilities that allow me to convey complex concepts clearly and work efficiently in teams.
I'm seeking opportunities in technology where I can apply my knowledge, collaborate on challenging projects, and continue growing as a professional. I'm characterized by being proactive, creative, and committed, always ready to face new challenges.
